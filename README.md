Pathway To Space Invaders
========================

About
-----
Pathway To Space Invaders is similar to the classic arcade game Space Invaders with a theme for my Pathway to Space class at CU. My goal with this project was to get some practice coding in Python. In the game the user controls the ship located at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship left and right and can press Spacebar to fire a missile at the enemies located near the top of the screen. The enemies fire missiles at the ship as they move across the screen. When an enemy hits the edge of the screen they move down toward the ship. The player scores points for destroying invaders. The game ends when the ship is destroyed by an invader or if one of the invaders reaches the bottom of the screen.

In a terminal type: "python Invaders.py"

This game uses Python 2.7 and Pygame both must be installed to run the game.
